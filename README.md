To deploy an Arduino based RFID mechanism to allot parking facilities for two, three and four wheelers. Aim to in co-operate this system in shopping complex where the vehicles have to wait in long queue to get their respective parking slots thereby avoiding traffic. The current mechanism requires man power but plan to implement a fully automated system.
