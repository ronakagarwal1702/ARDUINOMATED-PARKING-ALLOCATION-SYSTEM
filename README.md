# ARDUINOMATED-PARKING-ALLOCATION-SYSTEM

To deploy an Arduino based RFID mechanism to allot parking facilities for two, three and four wheelers. Aim to in co-operate this system in shopping complex where the vehicles have to wait in long queue to get their respective parking slots thereby avoiding traffic. The current mechanism requires man power but plan to implement a fully automated system.

The flow will be such that all the customers coming in the complex will be provided with a rechargeable smart C-card, which has a RFID tag embedded in it. As soon as the customers scans the card through the RFID tag reader following things will be noted in the data base. If it’s the customer’s first visit then a message stating that a new registration number has been detected will be displayed .At the same time a permanent registration number corresponding to that card will be assigned. Entry time will also be stored so that at the time of exit appropriate amount will be deducted depending on the duration of parking. Simultaneously in the backend we plan to implement the data structures for allotment of the car parking which will be displayed in the GUI.
